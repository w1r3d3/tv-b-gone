Schematics and firmware for a remote control, capable of switching on/off any television sets.

Some modification of the original TV-B-Gone remote control device, capable of switching on/off any television sets. This version builds upon the more common and cheaper ATmega48/88 uC and shows off with far smaller pgm-memory consumption featuring an improved compressor for the code tables.
